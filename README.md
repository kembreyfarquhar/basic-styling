# Basic Styling

This app was made as a tool to help anyone that's having a hard time selecting a style library or method of styling. This site allows users to view different options such as Material-UI, Semantic-UI, and custom SASS. It also displays the source code for both styling and JSX to help the user understand how the styling was set up. Built using React.
